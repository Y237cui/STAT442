LeBron James was born on 30 December 1984 in Akron, Ohio
A generational talent from the moment he stepped onto the court at St. Vincent St. Mary High School,
LeBron skipped college and entered the 2003 NBA Draft and chosen first overall by his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers
Over two decades he has starred for Cleveland, Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers, winning four NBA championships, four MVP titles, and etching his name in history as the league's all-time leading scorer.

As the NBA's time leading scorer, LeBron James has turned every inch of the hardwood into his personal canvas.
Each dot on this chart captures the precision and power of a man who defies gravity on a nightly basis - whether splashing threes from the wing or bulldozing to the rim.
Here, you witness not just statistics but the heartbeat of a champion: relentless ambition, unwavering focus, and the artistry of a player who writes history one shot at a time.


Over two decades in the NBA, LeBron James has redefined greatness - not just with his scoring, but through his vision, leadership, and impact on both ends of the court.
This table captures every heartbeat of LeBron James on the hardwood: his scoring speaks of relentless will, rebounds and assists showcase his all around dominance, FG% and plus\u8209 minus reflect his command of the game's flow, and the win/loss icons embody his unwavering competitive spirit.


When I first watched NBA around 2014, at just eleven years old, I was completely spellbound by LeBron James.
Despite the doubters, in my eyes, he shouldered all of Cleveland's hopes and shattered a 50\uc0\u8209 year title drought, bringing the city its first championship ever.\
His story of rising from a child in a tough neighborhood to one of the game's immortals has always been encouraging me to trust myself and aspire for great goals.\
Beyond his charms in basketball, his contribution out off the court - building the "PROMISE" School, lifting up his community, and giving hope to so many.\
LeBron's resilience, generosity, unbreakable spirit, it all reminds me that greatness comes from lifting others as you climb.}
